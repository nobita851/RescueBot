# RescueBot
This bot is a solution to counter sweeper bots on compromised Ethereum wallets that attempt to drain funds using the Flashbots bundle submission mechanism. Flashbots is a research and development organization focused on minimizing the negative externalities of MEV (Miner Extractable Value) extraction techniques, including those used by sweeper bots. This solution aims to protect compromised wallets from unauthorized fund withdrawal attempts.

## Background
Sweeper bots are malicious scripts or bots that gain unauthorized access to Ethereum wallets and attempt to drain the funds by exploiting vulnerabilities in various smart contracts or DeFi protocols. Flashbots introduced a new way of submitting bundles of transactions directly to miners, which helps in reducing MEV-related risks and increasing the transparency of transaction ordering. However, malicious actors have also attempted to use Flashbots for their own gain.
